The trajectory details the development of a robotics engineering portfolio application from inception to a highly polished state. Initially, the AI engineer established a React/FastAPI/MongoDB full-stack environment. The user provided resume data, requesting an Apple-style, recruiter-impressing design. The AI iteratively built the frontend with mock data, implementing core sections like Hero, Robot, and Human Pose, and addressing initial rendering bugs.

Subsequent user feedback significantly escalated requirements, demanding advanced animations (Framer Motion, GSAP), 3D model interactions (React-Three-Fiber), and a blend of Apple's premium aesthetic with Tesla's engineering focus. The AI adapted, ditching a full Next.js rebuild, and focused on enhancing the existing React codebase. Key tasks involved redesigning sections for sharp edges, optimized spacing, integrating interactive charts, rich media (videos/images), a projects carousel, and a comprehensive student-focused footer. The AI then refined the portfolio to Apple engineering standards, emphasizing a problem-solution-impact narrative and code snippets. The last critical user feedback highlighted a broken humanoid section layout and bland shadow boxes, which the AI attempted to fix by redesigning the  for a creative, clean, cold, and professional look. The AI concluded by providing setup instructions.
